## About This Portfolio

This portfolio was built to showcase my journey and skills as a **front-end focused software engineer** who can also deliver **full-stack features** end-to-end.  
Unlike a typical static portfolio, this site includes **evidence-based case studies**, real performance metrics, live demos, and interactive components that prove my projects scale in the real world.

The portfolio is more than just a collection of links — it’s designed to be:

- 📊 **Data-driven**: includes Lighthouse metrics, bundle sizes, and before/after screenshots.
- 🧭 **Clear and professional**: simple navigation between Home, Projects, Build Log, and About.
- 📱 **Fully responsive**: optimized for desktop and mobile with clean UI and accessibility in mind.
- ⚡ **Fast & reliable**: built with modern tooling (Vite + React) and deployed on Netlify.
